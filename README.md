# xray-manager
Python script to easy deploy, configure, remove and backup Xray service [https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core] on your Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Redhat/CentOS/ORacle Linux) server machine.

This script needs to be run on Python 3.10 or higher due to use of "match/case" structure.
It only supports whatever it installed due to some additional files and hardcoded installation paths.
Needs to be run from /opt or it's subdirectories.
